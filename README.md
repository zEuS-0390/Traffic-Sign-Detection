# Voice Assisted Traffic Sign Detection

It uses state-of-the-art object detection algorithm (YOLO) to identify regulatory and warning traffic signs. The dataset is a collection of images with different classes found across the internet. We used browser extension to gather images from several image hosting sites and also utilized road trip videos to gather field data.
